Software Testing and Quality Assurance 
Library Review system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain 
all the daily work of a library like collecting reviews, managing rating of dishes etc. This project has many 
features which are generally not available in normal library management systems like facility of user login. 
This login feature for the user is provided in order to provide the security to the application. It also has a 
facility of viewing all the available dishes available in librarys. Through the login, the admin can monitor 
the whole system by the proficient use of the login through which he can monitor the whole system. It also 
has the facility of an online view- board where librarian can put up information about the books those are 
currently available in the library. It has also a facility where a record is maintained of the books those have 
been issued by the students. When the student issues the book, the book name gets added in the list of the 
issued books and whenever the student s returns the book, then the books gets removed from the list of 
issued books. The librarian after logging into his account i.e. admin account can perform various functions 
such as adding books, removing books and issuing of books.

way possible and also reduce the human efforts
